# Instructions for CSSE/MA 490 AGT Lab 2
- This lab is adapted from Lab 6 of Dr. Amy Greenwald's [course](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1440/labs/) at Brown University. 
- You should be able to reuse the same Python virtual environment you created for Lab 1. 
- You will again work in pairs and together submit one set of code files and one write-up to Gradescope. 
- This README clarifies what is expected in your lab write-up. The primary source for instructions is Dr. Greenwald's [lab 6 handout](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1440/labs/2025/Lab_6_Writeup.pdf). 
- Note on the "To Be Continued..." at the end: We may continue to the follow-up lab for Lab 4 in Week 7, if there's interest and I do not come up with a different option in the meantime more closely related to Week 7 content. **Please let me know** (either in-person or at the end of your lab write-up) your interest level in continuing to the follow-up lab. 

## Lab Write-up Q1
See the bottom of page 2 and top of page 3 of the lab 6 handout. 

(a) Answer the first question (marginal values for the first camera and flash example). 

(b) Answer the second question (marginal values for the second example). 

## Lab Write-up Q2
See the Example and Question in the middle of page 3. Answer each part: 

(a) What utility would LocalBid obtain in this example? 

(b) Devise an alternate bidding strategy that achieves the same performance in this example. 

## Lab Write-up Q3 
See the paragraph on page 6 of the lab 6 handout beginning "Recall from Section 3.4". Answer each part: 

(a) How many iterations is enough to guarantee convergence? 

(b) Are there some valuation functions for which LocalBid isn't guaranteed to converge at all? 

## Lab Write-up Q4
See the Extra Credit item on page 6 of the lab 6 handout. 

Give a concrete example where LocalBid without smoothing is not guaranteed to converge. 

## Submission to Gradescope
1. In the "Lab 2 Code" dropbox on Gradescope, upload all four of your Python files for this lab: 
- `localbid.py`
- `marginal_value.py`
- `sample_valuations.py` (should not need to change this file)
- `test_marginal_value.py`

2. In the "Lab 2 Write-up" dropbox on Gradescope, upload your responses to the lab write-up questions as a PDF.
